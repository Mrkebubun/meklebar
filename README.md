# Meklebar

[Bitcoin contracts](http://bitcoin.it/wiki/Contracts) are awesome. Yet,
almost no wallet application allows creation of something more than
just a pay-to-address- transaction. Merkle aims to bridge this gap and
allow creation of escrow transactions no matter what wallet app you use.

Merklebar is a fully client-side application. It does not store or
transmit your private keys over the net. All signing and transaction
making is done locally. The only things it uses the net for are
transaction information retrieval and transaction pushing.
